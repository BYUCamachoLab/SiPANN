 # Examples
 
This directory contains various examples and tutorials that illustrate the power of using ANNs to design silicon photonic circuits.
 
 ## Running Examples
 
 In order to run the ipython notebooks (either in ipython, jupyter, or jupyter lab) the SiP-ANN package needs to be installed. See installation instructions in the parent directory.
 
 ## Descriptions
 
 `ringResonator.ipynb` - Simulates the scattering parameters for ring resonators using various ANNs. Simulations update in real time using interactive widgets.
 
 `waveguide.ipynb` - Simulates the effective index and group index for straight, bent, and curved waveguides using various ANNs.
 
 `ICBG.ipynb` - Simulates the reflection and group delay profiles of integrated chirped Bragg gratings (ICBG).
